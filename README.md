### As a User & Foodie

I love trying out new restaurants and dishes. I wanted to find a website that features reviews from other customers and where I can share my experience. I was excited to try it out and see what others had to say about the dishes I am interested in.

I start by browsing the website and searching for a specific restaurant that I had been wanting to try. The website is easy to navigate and found the restaurant’s page, which featured a menu, photos, and customer reviews. I am pleased to see that most customers had positive experiences with the food.After reading the reviews, I decided to visit the resturant and order the dish I was intrested in and it was delicious - just as the reviews had mentioned.

Overall, the customer reviews were helpful in guiding my choices. I can use this website again in the future to discover new restaurants and dishes.
